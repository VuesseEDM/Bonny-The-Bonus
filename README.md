# Bonny the Bonus   
---  

   
 ## Description

I developed this project with TypeScript and it models the operational structure of a startup dedicated to facilitating citizens' access to state bonuses. The system focuses on the interactions between startups, state incentives, and participating citizens.
This project was created to support the TypeScript test on [S2I](https://www.start2impact.it/master/)

## Project Components

The project uses TypeScript to define interfaces and classes that represent the various components of the system:

- **IStartup**: interface that describes the characteristics of a startup.
- **IIncentivo**:  interface that defines the attributes of a state incentive.
- **ICittadino**: interface that represents the information of a participating citizen,



## Usage

You can clone the repository using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VuesseEDM/Bonny-The-Bonus.git 

After cloning the repository, run the command:


- npm install

- npm start


This will install all the necessary dependencies.



```
